# Converting Files to HTML

## Docx to HTML

We use the [mammoth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mammoth) library to convert
DOCX files to HTML format. Mammoth focuses on generating clean and simple HTML
by extracting the meaningful content from the DOCX file while ignoring complex
formatting and styles that are not essential for web display.

### Installation

To use this library, you need to install it via npm. You can do this by running
the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install mammoth
```

## PDF to HTML

We use the [pdf2html](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf2html) library to convert
PDF documents to HTML format. This allows us to easily make the content
available as documents for editing or viewing within our application.

### Installation

To use this library, you need to install it via npm. You can do this by running
the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install pdf2html
```
